# hello-world

Hi Everyone!!

I"m new here and comeing from and ShoreTel administrator background. I spend most my days looking through call logs and troubleshooting network issues. Trying to learn programming and currently starting with python.
Point in the right direction so I can learn all I can. I prefer to do baby steps and keep it fun.
